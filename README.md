Discordeno + @discordjs/voice Example

## Discordeno v19 Support

Please check the v19 branch. Once v19 releases, this branch will be renamed to v18 and that one will become the new main branch.

## How to run

1. Fill the correct token in `token.json`
2. Run the bot using `npm start`
3. Connect to a voice channel and send `!join` in that voice channel's chat
4. Profit

This is extremely basic just to get it working. It can be vastly improved. For that reason, I recommend against using this as a template. It's just an example.
